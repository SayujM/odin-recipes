        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.</li>
            <li>Using a pastry blender or two knives, cut the cold butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
            <li>Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing until the dough just comes together. Be careful not to over-mix.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough in half, shape into disks, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine blackberries, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Toss gently to coat.</li>
            <li>Let the mixture stand for about 15 minutes to allow the juices to thicken.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
            <li>Roll out one pie crust to fit a 9-inch pie dish. Pour the blackberry filling into the prepared crust.</li>
            <li>Cover with the top crust, vent, and crimp the edges.</li>
            <li>Bake for 15 minutes at 425°F, then reduce the temperature to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>Bake for an additional 30-35 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.</li>
            <li>Let cool completely on a wire rack before serving.</li>
