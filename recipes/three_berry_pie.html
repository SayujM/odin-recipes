            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.</li>
            <li>Using a pastry blender or two knives, cut the cold butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
            <li>Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing until the dough just comes together. Be careful not to over-mix.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough in half, shape into disks, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, whisk together sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Pour the sugar mixture over the berries and toss gently to coat. Let stand for about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
            <li>Roll out one pie crust to fit a 9-inch pie dish. Pour the berry filling into the prepared crust.</li>
            <li>Cover with the top crust, vent, and crimp the edges.</li>
            <li>Bake for 15 minutes at 425°F, then reduce the temperature to 375°F (190°C)</li>
