        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A cloud-like crust cradles a jewel-toned sea of plump, juicy blueberries, </p>
        <p>their sweet-tart symphony bursting forth with each tender bite. </p>
        <p>A whisper of cinnamon and nutmeg dances with the berries,</p> 
        <p>while the flaky, buttery crust melts in your mouth,</p> 
        <p>leaving behind a blissful taste of summer perfection.</p>        
        <p></p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All-purpose flour</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Cold & normal butter</li>
            <li>Ice water</li>
            <li>Fresh blueberries</li>
            <li>White sugar</li>
            <li>Cornstarch</li>
            <li>Beaten Eggs</li>
            <li>Lemon juice</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.</li>
            <li>Using a pastry blender or two knives, cut the cold butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
            <li>Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing until the dough just comes together. Be careful not to over-mix.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough in half, shape into disks, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour, cinnamon, cornstarch and salt. Gently stir in the blueberries and lemon juice</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together sugar, flour, and salt.</li>
            <li>Add eggs and sour cream, whisking until smooth.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>Roll out the pie dough on a lightly floured surface to a 12-inch circle.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough to a 9-inch pie dish and trim the edges.</li>
            <li>Pour the blueberry filling into the prepared pie crust.</li>
            <li>Pour the custard mixture evenly over the blueberries.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine the streusel ingredients and cut in the butter until crumbly.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the streusel topping over the custard.</li>
            <li>Cover the pie edges with foil to prevent excessive browning.</li>
            <li>Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.</li>
            <li>Remove the foil for the last 10 minutes of baking to allow the crust to brown.</li>
            <li>Let the pie cool completely on a wire rack before serving.</li>
        </ol>
