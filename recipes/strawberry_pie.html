        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>A cloud of sweet summer bliss. </strong></p>
        <p>A buttery, flaky crust cradles a jewel-toned cascade of ripe, juicy strawberries, bathed in a sun-kissed glaze.</p>
        <p>Each tender bite is a burst of fruity perfection, leaving behind a whisper of vanilla and a lingering smile.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>All-purpose flour</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Cold & normal butter</li>
            <li>Ice water</li>
            <li>Fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced</li>
            <li>White sugar</li>
            <li>Cornstarch</li>
            <li>Ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>Lemon juice</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.</li>
            <li>Using a pastry blender or two knives, cut the cold butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
            <li>Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing until the dough just comes together. Be careful not to over-mix.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough in half, shape into disks, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> In a large bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour, cinnamon, cornstarch and salt. Gently stir in the sliced strawberries and lemon juice</li>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out one of the chilled dough disks to a 12-inch diameter. Fit it into a 9-inch pie dish, trimming the edges as needed.</li>
            <li>Pour the strawberry filling into the prepared pie crust. Dot with butter pieces.</li>
            <li>Roll out the second dough disk and place it over the filling. Trim the edges, crimp, and cut slits in the top crust for venting.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425째F (220째C). Bake the pie for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 375째F (190째C) and bake for an additional 30-35 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.</li>
            <li>Let the pie cool completely on a wire rack before serving.</li>
        </ol>
